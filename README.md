## Objective

The objective of the second phase of the final project is to implement the solution that was designed in the first phase using MySQL in a cloud environment. You may realize that it‚Äôs necessary to consider modifications to the design in order to have a working solution satisfying the expected functionality and you should update your design appropriately, if necessary.

For Phase II you will translate the design into a functional solution by:1. Creating MySQL database tables using proper data types, constraints, and keys according to the design proposed or your revised design.2. Populating the tables using sample data, maintaining the consistency and integrity of the data. There should be enough sample data to allow for a meaningful demonstration of the functionality of the solution.3. Creating SQL queries to select, insert, update, and delete data from tables, according to the expected functionality described in the problem statement.4. Creating views, triggers, and procedures to facilitate the usage and manipulation of the database.5. Implementing user roles and authentication procedures needed to keep your data secure.6. Creating a web interface that connects to your cloud-based database implementation to give the end user the ability to access and manipulate the data.7. Creating a recorded demonstration of the functionality of your database and how it contributes to the solution to the original problem statement.

The main aim is to implement the database satisfying the information and functional requisites extracted from the analysis of the problem statement, in order to demonstrate your expertise and proficiency on the use of database methodologies to create an accurate and faithful database. The implementation must reflect all expected information, scenarios, and functionality.

## Guidelines

You are to use the Amazon Web Services(AWS) Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for the database implementation.

You are responsible for providing all necessary information for the evaluation of your projects. Should any username/password be required to access the database and AWS, they must be provided as well so that I can test all the functionality of the database and its correctness.

All transactions, errors and constraint-checking must be carried out using the proper database procedures. The consistency, integrity, and security of the information in the database is a priority and will be evaluated.
